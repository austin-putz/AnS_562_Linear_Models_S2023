# R

All the code in R for the semester will be in this directory. 

## Quarto

All quarto files have the extension of `.qmd`. This is the new version of RMarkdown if you are familiar with the older way to knitr reports into HTML, Word, or PDF. 

You must first download Quarto from here: [Quarto Download Link](https://quarto.org/docs/download/index.html)

Please also download RStudio to make it easier for you: [RStudio Download](https://posit.co/downloads/)

You can 'Render' documents from within RStudio after you have Quarto downloaded. 

## Pedigree Folder

Please see the `Pedigree/` folder for needed functions for the relationship matrix R script.
